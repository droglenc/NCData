# BOD.csv
# An aquaculture farm takes water from a stream and returns it to the stream after it
#   has circulated through the fish tanks. The owner is concerned that the water may
#   contain heightened levels of organic matter when it is released into the stream after it
#   has circulated in the tanks. He has taken steps to reduce this possibility, i.e., circulated
#   the water rather quickly through the tanks, but is still concerned about the increase in
#   organic material in the effluent. To determine if this is true, he takes samples of the
#   water at the intake and, at other times, downstream from the outlet and measures the
#   biological oxygen demand (BOD) as a measure of the organics in the effluent (a higher
#   BOD at the outlet would imply that organics are taken up from the tanks).
# BOD: BOD measurement
# src: source (inlet or outlet) of measurement
