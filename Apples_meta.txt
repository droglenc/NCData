# A randomized complete block design was used to investigate the effects
#   of four fertilizer treatments on the (TN) total nitrogen, (PN) pit
#   nitrogen, (P) phosphorus, (K) potassium, (CA) calcium, (MG) magnesium,
#   and (Weight) mean fruit weight of apples. The four treatments were:
#   (A) Control, (B) Urea, (C), Calcium and Potassium Nitrates, and (D) Ammonium and Sulfate.
# ttlN: total Nitrogen
# pitN: pit Nitrogen
# P: Phosphorous
# K: Potassium
# Ca: Calcium
# Mg: Magnesium
# wght: mean weight of apples in plot
