# The authors conducted an experiment evaluating whether sterilizing the dominant male in 
#   a herd of wild horses would reduce foaling (birth) rates for 2 or more years. In 
#   December 1985, they rounded up bands of horses from two Herd Management Areas. They 
#   vasectomized the dominant male in each band and released the horses. Between_June 1986 
#   and_July 1988 they attempted to locate the bands of horses 3-4 times a year by aerial 
#   survey from a helicopter. The researchers recorded the number of adults and foals in 
#   each group containing a sterilized male (treated groups), and in the groups without a 
#   sterilized male (untreated groups).
