# Typical worker honey bees can carry an average of 113 mg of nectar per trip to a
#   source of pollen.  An Italian company is interested exporting honey bees that can carry
#   more nectar then the typical honey bee.  To examine this ability they measured the nectar
#   carried by 32 of the Italian bees.
