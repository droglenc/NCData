# The A.C. Nielsen Company collects data on the TV viewing habits of Americans and
#   publishes the information in Nielsen Report on Television.  Twenty married couples
#   (note that married couples tend to watch similar amounts of TV) are randomly selected
#   and the weekly viewing times, in hours, for the couples were recorded.
