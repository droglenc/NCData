# Morphological measurements on mountain bushytail possums from Australia
#  site: one of seven trapping locations
#  pop: a location factor (Vic=Victoria, Other=New South Wales or Queensland
#  age: age of possum
#  totlen: total length (cm)
#  headlen: head length (mm)
#  skullwid: skull width (mm)
#  earconch: ear conch length (mm)
#  eyedist: distance from medial canthus to lateral canthus of right eye (mm)
#  miss: logical for whether individual contains any missing data
#  out: logical for whether individual contains any outlier data
# If the data are read into an object called P then use the following commands to obtain a
#   "clean" data set -- i.e., this removes individuals with missing data or erroneous outliers
#      P1 <- subset(P,!P$miss & !P$out)
# The site variable should be converted to a factor variable ==>  P1$f.site <- factor(P1$site)
