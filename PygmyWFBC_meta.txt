# Note the following (assumes that your data are in an objected called df):
#  1. The levels for month should be controlled with
#
#   df$month <- factor(df$month,levels=c("May","June","July","August","September","October","November"))
#
#  2. The year variable should be converted to a factor (i.e., categorical) with
#
#   df$year <- factor(df$year)
#
#  3. Remove "bad" records with
#
#   df <- filterD(df,USE)
#
#     the USE variable can be ignored after this.
