# scale_age: Scale age (in years)
# oto_age: Otolith age (in years)
# USE: Should the individual be used for analyses.
#
# Note the following (assumes that your data are in an objected called df):
#  1. The levels for sex and mat should be controlled with
#
#   df$sex <- factor(df$sex,levels=c("Imm","F","M"))
#   df$mat <- factor(df$mat,levels=c("Imm","MG","MT"))
#
#  2. The year variable should be converted to a factor (i.e., categorical) with
#
#   df$year <- factor(df$year)
#
#  3. Remove "bad" records with
#
#   df <- filterD(df,USE)
#
#     the USE variable can be ignored after this.
