#
# year: Year of capture (2000, 2001)
# month: Month of capture
# week: Week within a month of capture

# fl: Fork length (cm)
# tl: Total length (cm)
# wt: Weight (g)
# sex: Sex code (F=Female, M=Male, Imm=immature)
# mat: Maturity code (Imm=immature, MG=maturing, MT=mature)
# scale_age: Scale age (in years)
# oto_age: Otolith age (in years)
# USE: Should the individual be used for analyses.
#
# Note that the levels for sex and mat should be controlled as follows
#  (this assumes that your data are in an objected called df):
#
# df$sex <- factor(df$sex,levels=c("Imm","F","M"))
# df$mat <- factor(df$mat,levels=c("Imm","MG","MT"))
#
# Finally, these data have lots of missing values that were coded with blanks.
#   These can be removed with the following code:
#
#   df <- filterD(df,!USE)
#
# Following that the USE variable can be ignored.
