# In an effort to determine effective hand-raising protocols for pronghorn antelope
#   (Antilocapra americana), Martin and Parker (1997; J. Wildl. Man. 78:23-30) examined
#   the growth rates of two groups of pronghorns for the first 16 weeks of their lives.
#   The first group consisted of tame animals.  The second group originated from wild stock
#   and was labeled "diet-curtailed" because their diet of artificial milk had to be
#   curtailed to avoid problems with diarrhea.  Martin and Parker measured the body weight 
#   (kg) of each animal on various days during the 16 weeks.
# age: age (in days)
# wt: weight (kg)
# group: treatment group (curtailed, wild)
