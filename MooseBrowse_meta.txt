# The height of Scots pine trees in three treatment groups
#   height: height of tree (cm)
#   treat: the treatment group
#     Control: no manipulation
#     Fertilized: 60g of nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) was applied to the soil within a 2-m
#                 radius of each tree at the beginning of the growing season
#     Clipped: all shoots produced in the previous growing year were removed
#     Shaded: the top- and lateral-most branches were covered with a shade cloth that reduced
#             the light intensity by 50% in the 400-700 nm wavelengths.
