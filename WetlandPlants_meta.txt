# species: scientific name
# L: lag time (days from the beginning of the experiment until
#    first seed germination)
# Gmax: maximum germination rate (% per day) -- maximum proportion
#    of germinable seeds that germinate in 1 day
# G: final germination percent -- percent of the seeds that had
#    germinated by end of 30-d experiment
# S: seed weight (10e-5 g) -- averaged over at least 25 seeds
# R: seedling relative growth rate (g/g/d)
# type: classification type (OP=obligate perennials, FA=facultative
