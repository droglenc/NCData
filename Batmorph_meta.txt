# Originally from Dr. Andrew Taylor -- http://www2.hawaii.edu/~taylor/
# I put names in subspecies code and added a habitat variable (this is not actual habitats, though.  I
#   simply wanted a second categorical variable for analysis).
# subsp: subspecies names (Hawaiian = semotus, Mainland = cinereus)
# bodymass: total body mass (g) at time of collection
# skulllength: skull length (cm)
# canine: height (cm) of upper left canine tooth
# coronoid: height (cm) of left coronoid process
# wingspan: total wingspan (m)
# hab: habitat of capture (generically labeled as A, B,C)
