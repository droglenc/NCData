# PiceaTrees.csv
#
# Data filtered from a dataset of forest biomass structure for
#  Eurasia available athttps://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201770
#
# Species: Species of tree (all Picea abies (L) Karst.) 
# Origin: Natural or planted
# Age: Age of tree (years)
# DBH: Diameter-at-breast-height (cm)
# Ht: Tree height (m)
# Pst: Live biomass of stem over bak (dried KG)
# Pbr: Stem bark biomass (dried KG)
# Pf: Foliage biomas (dried KG)
# Pabo: Above-ground biomass (dried KG)
# Country: Country location of tree (RUSsia or KAZhakstan)
# GAge: Grouped age (<50, 50-100, >100).
#
# You should control the levels of the GAge variable as shown
#   below assuming that your data is an objected called df
#
# df$GAge <- factor(df$GAge,levels=c("<50","50-100",">100"))
