# from Folkow and Blix (1987; American Journal of Phsyiology)
#   wanted to better understand the mechanisms that aided blood flow and body temperature regulation
#   in northern gray seals (Halichoerus grypus).  To get an overall look at body temperature regulation
#   they calculated the seals’ thermal conductivity (a measure of how easily the body loses heat) at
#   ambient water temperatures between -40C and 20C.
# thermcond: seals’s thermal conductivity; W/(m^2*C))
# ambtemp: ambient water temperature (C)
