# Morphological measurements on a sample of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus)
#  captured at various locations in the St. Louis River Harbor, Lake Superior.
#
#  loc: location of collection: Allouez Bay, Interstate Island, Whaleback Bay
#  sex: sex of the fish: m=male, f=female
#  tl: total length (mm)
#  w: weight (g)
#  bg: body girth (mm)
#  ujl: upper jaw length (mm)
#  slla: scale along the lateral line
#  miss: logical is TRUE if some data is missing
#  out: Logical is TRUE if some data appears erroneous
#
# If data are read into an object called RM, then use the following to obtain a
#   "clean" data set -- i.e., remove missing data and erroneous outliers
#
#   RM <- RM[!RM$miss & !RM$out,]
