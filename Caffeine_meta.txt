# Caffeine.csv
# A study of the effect of caffeine on muscle metabolism used 36 male volunteers who
#   each underwent arm exercise tests.  Eighteen of the men were randomly selected to
#   take a capsule containing pure caffeine one hour before the test.  The other men
#   received a placebo capsule.  During each exercise the subject's respiratory exchange
#   ratio (RER) was measured. [RER is the ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed and is an
#   indicator of whether energy is being obtained from carbohydrates or fats).
# RER: respiratory exchange ratio
# treatment: treatment group (caffeine or placebo)
