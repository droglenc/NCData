# PetCommitment.csv
# A researcher has constructed a "survey" to determine an individual person's "commitment to
#   adult animals."  Each individual survey leads to a single number that measures that
#   individuals "commitment."  This number is larger for "greater commitments."  The researcher
#   wanted to determine if the mean "commitment" according to this measure was greater for
#   people who evacuated all or some of their pets versus those who did not evacuate any pets
#   during a propane tanker derailment in Weyauwega, Wisconsin in 1996. 
# commitment: "commitment" level as determined from the survey
# evacuate: a logical indicating whether they evacuated their pet or not.
