# Morphological measurements on mountain bushytail possums from Australia
#  site: one of seven trapping locations
#  pop: a location factor (Vic=Victoria, Other=New South Wales or Queensland)
#  age: age of possum
#  totlen: total length (cm)
#  chest: chest girth (cm)
#  belly: belly girth (cm)
#  taillen: tail length (cm)
#  footlen: foot length (mm)
#  miss: logical for whether individual contains any missing data
#  out: logical for whether individual contains any outlier data
# 
# If the data are read into an object called P then use the following commands to obtain a
#   "clean" data set -- i.e., this removes individuals with missing data or erroneous outliers
#
#    P <- P[!P$miss & !P$out,]
#
# In addition, the site variable should be converted to a factor variable -- i.e., 
#
#    P$site <- factor(P$site)
