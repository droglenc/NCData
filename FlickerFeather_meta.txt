# odd: "yellowness of an "odd" feather on the bird
# Feathers of northern flickers that regrow after being lost are often called "odd" feathers
#   because they appear to be of a different color or length.  Wiebe and Bortolotti (2002)
#   hypothesized that the "odd" feathers would appear less yellow than the typical feathers on
#   a northern flicker.  To test this hypothesis they measured the "yellowness" of one odd feather
#   on each of 16 birds and compared it with the "yellowness" of one typical feather from the same
#   bird (note that larger numbers mean "more yellow").
