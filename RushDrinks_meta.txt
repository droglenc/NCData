# RushDrinks.csv
# A report in the Journal of College Development (1994:346-353) examined factors associated
#   with the decision to rush a sorority.  As part of the analysis, a random sample of 54
#   women who rushed a sorority and 51 women who did not rush a sorority were asked how often
#   they drank alcoholic beverages per week (i.e., on how many days did they drink).
