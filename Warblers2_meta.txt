# loc: location of collection (Egypt, Ethiopia, or Tanzania)
# rbm: reduced body mass (g) -- body mass minus leg muscle mass
# legmusc: leg muscle mass (g) -- combined leg muscles attached to the Tibotarsus
# These data are for the spring migration (paper also presented autumn migration data)
# See Warblers1.csv for similar data on flight muscle mass
