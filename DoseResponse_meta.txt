# DoseResponse.csv
# It is common in water quality studies to conduct dose-response experiments.   In these experiments, groups of the zooplankter Daphnia spp. are exposed to different concentrations of a pollutant (the “dose”).  The mortality rate (i.e. percentage of the Daphnia that die) is recorded for each group (i.e., the “response”).  Generally speaking, the goal is to identify the relationship between the level of the pollutant (dose) and the mortality of the animal (response).  In an exercise to illustrate how to conduct these types of studies, students in the Northland College pollution biology course exposed ten groups of 20 Daphnia to one of three “doses” of chlorine (a model pollutant) -- dose A = 1 ppm, dose B = 10 ppm, and dose C = 100 ppm.  For each group they recorded the proportion of the 20 Daphnia that died during the course of the experiment.  In their particular study they want to determine if the mortality rate differs among the three levels of the pollutant
# dose: dose of chloring in ppm
# mort: mortality (proportion of 20 dead)
