#
# A teacher examined the effect of extra reading assignments on the vocabulary skills
#   of third grade children as part of her master's thesis.  Before the school year 25
#   students were randomly selected to participate in a traditional classroom (i.e.,
#   "control" group) and 25 were selected to be in a classroom that was assigned extra
#   reading assignments.  A standard vocabulary test was administered at the end of the
#   term (4 months).
