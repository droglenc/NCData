Description: Subjects were students in grades 4-6 from three school districts in Ingham and Clinton Counties, Michigan. Chase and Dummer (1992) stratified their sample, selecting students from urban, suburban, and rural school districts with approximately 1/3 of their sample coming from each district. Students indicated whether good grades, athletic ability, or popularity was most important to them. They also ranked four factors(grades, sports, looks, and money) in order of their importance for popularity. The questionnaire also asked for gender, grade level, and other demographic information.
