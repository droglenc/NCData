# These data are often used for a final exam in Ogle's Intro Stats course. For
#  that course, run the following code after you have read the data into the
#  df object to make the data easier to manage.
#
#    use.levs <- c("0_days","1_6_days","7_14_days","15_30_days","30_60_days","60+_days")
#    edu.levs <- c("ltHS","HS","someColl","College","GradProf")
#
#    df <- dplyr::select(df,lake:sumDays,educat,fishing,age,value)
#    df$fishing <- factor(df$fishing,levels=use.levs)
#    df$educat <- factor(df$educat,levels=edu.levs)
#    df$prmryRes <- factor(df$prmryRes,levels=c("No","Yes"))
