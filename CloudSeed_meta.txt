# CloudSeed.csv
# The effect of seeding clouds on the amount of rainfall produced was examined by randomly
#   selecting 26 days on which to seed clouds with silver nitrate.  Clouds from another 26
#   days were left unseeded (but a plane flew through the clouds in a manner similar to the
#   seeding).  On each of the 52 days, the amount of rainfall was measured (in acre-feet).
